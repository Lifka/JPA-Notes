# JPA Notes

This project is a simulation of a Java EE application using the JPA architecture, but abstracting from the top level user interface layer and focusing in the Domain Model and DAOs. We will perform an application of notes using Java Persistence API, focusing on the domain logic and mapping the classes defined in the design step with the database through JPA annotations.

The application will be similar to Google Keep, although obviously simpler, and without making the presentation layer. We will design the domain logic, maintain persistence through the JPA Entity Manager. To interact with the data will be used DAOs, and we will create controllers as the business logic layer. The following sections describe the features.
